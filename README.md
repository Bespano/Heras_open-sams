# SAMS
Web application for Social Assistance Management System (SAMS)

This is a CodeIgniter 3.1.2 PHP web application using Bootstrap 3 CSS.
MySQL is the database engine. 

# A little story

I've been working as a volunteer for 6 months in a non gubernamental organization helping people with their basics needs in terms of food or money. I have noticed how difficult is to put this help in place. We've been strugling to roll out some of our program lines due to not having a common information management system to establish a volunteers communication channel, or to manage benefactors and beneficiary data. At the very beginning we decided to start using some GoogleSpreadsheets through a shared Google Drive, but soon we discovered how hard is to keep track of the details when things start to scale up. 

Then we decided to start this project to build a complete modular web application that can be implemented, used and evolved by NGOs all around the world in order to develop their helping programs in a easy way. 

# The Project Vision
We want to build a community for developing a Social Assistance Management System Application (SAMSA) that can be used by NGOs as an Entreprise Information System integral platform, coping with data management, CRM activites, accounting, RGPD legal aspects, among others. 

# Goals and milestones
On the project side, our main goal is to develop a MVP that we will launch into our organization for social assistance management purposes. 
This MVP will have the basic features: 
* Authentication System. 
* Administration area. 
* * User management system: Users CRUD and permissions
* * Application configuration area: Activate/deactivate modules or features
* Superadministration area. 
* * Basic superadmin features
* Activity tracking record.
* * A basic tracking record in which we could store what we do in a daily basis,  labelling with a category and a subcategory and including the accounting data. 
* Pantry shelf area.
* Volunteers area.
* Dashboard area.
