# HERAS_open-SAMS
HERAS Open Web application for Social Assistance Management System (SAMS)

This is a CodeIgniter 3.1.2 PHP web application using Bootstrap 3 CSS and MySQL as the database engine. 

# A little story

I've been working as a volunteer for several months in a "Hermandad", a catholic organisation which aims to becoming a major vehicule on promoting christianity,  with a shared dedication on solidarity and charity, helping people with their basics needs in terms of food or money. I have noticed how difficult is to put this help in place. We've been struggling to roll out some of our program lines due to not having a common information management system to establish a volunteers communication channel, or to manage benefactors and beneficiary data. At the very beginning we decided to start using some GoogleSpreadsheets through a shared Google Drive, but soon we discovered how hard is to keep track of the details when things start to scale up. 

I was wondering how non gubernamental organisations (NGOs) or other organisations manage to run this kind of tasks when your main purpose is to provide help with a group of volunteers and with a very limited budget. That brought me to the idea of developing a web application that could be used by organisations all over the world with no budget but with an army of volunteers full of passion

This is whay we decided to start this project to build a complete modular web application that can be implemented, used and evolved by NGOs all around the world in order to develop their helping programs in an easy way. 

# The Project Vision
We want to build a community for developing a Social Assistance Management System Application (SAMSA) that can be used by NGOs as an Entreprise Information System integral platform, coping with data management, CRM activites, accounting, RGPD legal aspects, among others. 

# Goals and milestones
On the project side, our main goal is to develop a MVP that we will launch into our organization for social assistance management purposes. 
This MVP will have the basic features: 
* Authentication System. 
* Administration area. 
* * User management system: Users CRUD and permissions
* * Application configuration area: Activate/deactivate modules or features
* Superadministration area. 
* * Basic superadmin features
* Activity tracking record.
* * A basic tracking record in which we could store what we do in a daily basis,  labelling with a category and a subcategory and including the accounting data. 
* Pantry shelf area.
* Volunteers area.
* Dashboard area. 

Take a look at our Roadmap Wiki Page to go into the details.
